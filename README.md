a distributed ballot system

or a distributed polling systemðŸ—³, which is a decentralized voting platform that leverages the Ethereum blockchainðŸ”— for its backend implementation. The smart contractðŸ“œ, deployed to the Ethereum network, serves as the backbone of the system and provides a secure and transparent mechanism for recording and counting votes. The user accounts interact with the smart contract to participate in the voting process. The frontend user interface is written in TypeScript and is deployed to IPFS, which ensures that user IP addresses are not logged and that the voting process remains anonymous. The interaction between the user accounts and the smart contract is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, preserving the transparency and security of the voting process and making it a part of the blockchain itself. This approach ensures that voter information is kept secureðŸ”’, private and anonymous, while providing a transparent and trustworthy mechanism for recording and counting votes.
